# Basic Classs and Object 
- Create a Car class with attributes like brand and model. Then create an instance of this class.


# Class Methods and Self
- Add a method to the Car class that displays the full name of the Car(brand and model)

# Inheritance:
- Create an ElectricCar class that inherits from the Car class and has an additional attribute battery_size

# Encapsulation:
- Modify the Car class to encapsulate the brand attribute, making it private and provide a getter method for it

# Polymorphism:
-  Demonstrate polymorphism by defining a method fuel_type in both Car and ElectricCar classes, but with different behaviors

# Class Variable:
- Add a class variable to Car that keeps track of the number of cars created

# Static Methods
- Add a static method to the Car class that returns a general description of a car

# Property Decorators
- Use a property decorator in the Car class to make the model attribute read-only

# Class Inheritance and isinsntance() Function
- Demonstrate the use of isinstance() to check if my_car is an instance of Car and Electric Car


# Multiple Inheritance
- Create two classes Battery and Engine, and let the Electric Car class inherit from both, demonstrating multiple inheritance
