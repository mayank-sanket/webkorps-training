# Problem 1: Timing Function Execution
- Write a decorator that measures the time a funciton takes to execute



# Problem 2: Debugging Function Calls
- Create a decorator to print the function name and the values of its arguments every time the function is called


# Cache Return Values
- Implement a decorator that caches the return values of a function, so that when it's called with the same arguments, the cached value is returned instead of re-executing the function
